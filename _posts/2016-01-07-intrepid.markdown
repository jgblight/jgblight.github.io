Intrepid is something I've worked on off and on for a while and an example of building something you wish someone else would make for you. Namely, I take a lot of pictures when I travel and I wanted to be able to present them in a way that preserved a sense of narrative, especially traveling over long distances, so I built a simple web app that laid out my photos on a map in chronological order. [This](http://intrepid.me/trip/5) is a trip to Peru and [this](http://intrepid.me/trip/6) is a trip to Hawaii.

This is an ongoing project. Mostly, I do a bunch of work right before I go away on a trip because that is when I most want to use it and, consequently, the thing is usually broken or not presentable whenever I am travelling. Most recently, the site itself was fine but I managed to break my phone just before leaving for a climbing trip and couldn't take any pictures.
