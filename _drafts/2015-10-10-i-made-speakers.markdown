So I just finished making a small set of Fab Speakers. I'm excited about this not because it's a particularly complicated project, nor because these are particularly high-quality speakers, but it represents the first time I've used soldering and/or 3D printing for something useful. The sound quality is decidedly OK. If you're the sort of person who plays music out of your laptop's built-in speakers, or if you regularly put your phone in a glass to make it louder, you may find that these speakers fill a gaping hole in your otherwise happy and fulfilling life; otherwise, they are nothing to write home about.







Instructions for the speakers are available [here] and I highly recommend it as a second or third soldering project. I also have the [shape files] for the enclosure pieces.
